Lung-pet-ct-dx dataset introduction
The Lung-PET-CT-Dx dataset contains CT and PET-CT DICOM images of patients with suspected lung cancer, along with XML annotation files that mark tumor locations using bounding boxes. All images were retrospectively acquired from patients who underwent standard-of-care PET/CT and lung biopsy, with the final diagnosis based on histopathological tissue analysis.

ðŸ§¬ Diagnostic Label Mapping
Patients are categorized into four lung cancer types based on their ID, with corresponding numeric labels for classification tasks:

'A' â€“ Adenocarcinoma (label 0)

'B' â€“ Small Cell Carcinoma (label 1)

'E' â€“ Large Cell Carcinoma (label 2)

'G' â€“ Squamous Cell Carcinoma (label 3)

ðŸ–¼ Imaging Protocol
CT Scans: Acquired with mediastinal (WW=350 HU, WL=40 HU) and lung (WW=1400 HU, WL=â€“700 HU) window settings, with slice thickness ranging from 0.625 mm to 5 mm. Reconstruction used 2 mm thickness in lung settings.

PET Scans:

Whole-body scans acquired 60 minutes after 18F-FDG injection (4.44 MBq/kg).

FDG dose: 168.72â€“468.79 MBq (avg. 295.8 Â± 64.8 MBq)

Uptake time: 27â€“171 min (avg. 70.4 Â± 24.9 min)

Patients fasted â‰¥6 hours and had blood glucose <11 mmol/L.

Image Fusion & Reconstruction:

One CT volume, one PET volume, and a fused PET-CT volume per patient.

CT resolution: 512Ã—512 @ 1Ã—1 mm

PET resolution: 200Ã—200 @ 4.07Ã—4.07 mm

Slice thickness: 1 mm for both modalities

PET images reconstructed using TrueX TOF

ðŸ§  Annotation Details
Tumor annotations were created and verified by a team of five experienced thoracic radiologists, two with over 15 years of experience and three with over 5 years. The annotation process included:

Initial labeling by one radiologist

Cross-verification by four others

All annotations saved in PASCAL VOC (XML) format using LabelImg

Compatible with pascal-voc-tools

Python tools are available to overlay bounding boxes on DICOM images for visualization.

ðŸ§ª Benchmarking & Model Performance
Two deep learning researchers used this dataset to train and evaluate several well-known object detection models, achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of approximately 0.87 on the validation set.
